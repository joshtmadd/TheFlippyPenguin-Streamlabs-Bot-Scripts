## Using These Scripts Yourself
If you want to use these scripts for your own bot, then follow these instructions:
- Download/clone the repo contents and stash them in your own bot.
  - The "official" way to import them is to zip the individual script folders and to have the bot import them, but copy and paste work just fine

- Once you get these contents into your script folder, click the refresh button on the bot and make sure they are listed below

If you don't know where your Script Folder is for your bot, then find the help button in he top right corner of the bot window and click on it then click on the dropdown option "Open Script Directory"
